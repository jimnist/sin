###some links

these articles were helpful in the creation of this code. i also made use of this book: [Service-Oriented Design with Ruby and Rails](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321659368/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321659368&linkCode=as2&tag=chamaxwoo-20) by Paul Dix even though i don't use rails.
